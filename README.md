The page has a form input where you can search for any city. Once a city is typed and the user clicks search, the current forecast is displayed at the top of the page, along with the 5 day forecast. The user city input is saved underneath the form as a button, and when clicked, the forecast can be displayed on the dashboard again without the user re-typing the city.
